# LangChain integration for SAP HANA Cloud

## About this project

Integrates LangChain with SAP HANA Cloud to make use of vector search, knowledge graph, and further in-database capabilities as part of LLM-driven applications.

## Requirements and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python Environment**: Ensure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed.
- **SAP HANA Cloud**: Access to a running SAP HANA Cloud instance.

### Installation

Install the LangChain SAP HANA Cloud integration package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -U langchain-hana
```

### Vectorstore

The `HanaDB` class is used to connect to SAP HANA Cloud Vector Engine.

>[SAP HANA Cloud Vector Engine](https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-vector-engine-guide/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-vector-engine-guide) is
> a vector store fully integrated into the `SAP HANA Cloud` database.

See a [usage example](https://github.com/SAP/langchain-integration-for-sap-hana-cloud/blob/main/examples/sap_hanavector.ipynb).

```python
from langchain_hana import HanaDB
```

> **Important**:  You can use any embedding class that inherits from `langchain_core.embeddings.Embeddings`—**including** `HanaInternalEmbeddings`, which runs SAP HANA’s `VECTOR_EMBEDDING()` function internally. See [SAP Help](https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-vector-engine-guide/vector-embedding-function-vector?locale=en-US) for more details.

### Self Query Retriever

>[SAP HANA Cloud Vector Engine](https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-vector-engine-guide/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-vector-engine-guide)
> also provides a Self Query Retriever implementation using the `HanaTranslator` Class.

See a [usage example](https://github.com/SAP/langchain-integration-for-sap-hana-cloud/blob/main/examples/hanavector_self_query.ipynb).

```python
from langchain_hana import HanaTranslator
```

### Graph

>[SAP HANA Cloud Knowledge Graph Engine](https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-knowledge-graph-guide/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-knowledge-graph-engine-guide)
> provides support to utilise knowledge graphs through the `HanaRdfGraph` Class.

See a [usage example](https://github.com/SAP/langchain-integration-for-sap-hana-cloud/blob/main/examples/sap_hana_rdf_graph.ipynb).

```python
from langchain_hana import HanaRdfGraph
```

### Chains

A `SparqlQAChain` is also provided which can be used with `HanaRdfGraph` for SPARQL-QA tasks.
See a [usage example](https://github.com/SAP/langchain-integration-for-sap-hana-cloud/blob/main/examples/sap_hana_sparql_qa_chain.ipynb).

```python
from langchain_hana import HanaSparqlQAChain
```
